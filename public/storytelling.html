Her most distinctive feature is her bright red cape with a deep hood, which has become her signature look. The red cape symbolizes not just her name, but her courage, and she always wears it, even when walking through the dangerous Fairytale Forest.
                 She wears a simple yet charming outfit: a white blouse with short sleeves, a knee-length brown skirt, and sturdy brown shoes, perfect for walking through the forest. Over her blouse, she wears an apron, which she uses to collect cookies or flowers. Her cheerful personality shines through as she often picks flowers during her adventures.
                 Little Red Riding Hood loves to sing as she strolls through the forest, and her favorite place in the Efteling is her grandmother’s cottage, where she feels safe. Despite her fear of the wolf and the witch, she remains a brave girl, always ready to help her grandmother and friends like Little Thumb. Her clothing and appearance reflect both her youthful innocence and inner strength."
